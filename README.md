# Github Actions Workflow Templates

This is my collection of shared github actions workflows I use for my projects. --Unfortunately [sharing os only possible in organizations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/sharing-workflow-templates-within-your-organization).--

Hence I found [this post](https://medium.com/@er.singh.nitn/how-to-share-the-github-actions-workflow-in-an-organization-privately-c3bb3e0deb3), which has a nice approach.

- this repo holds all workflow templates
- updates of the templates trigger the workflows which adds the workflow templates to `.github/workflows` of the target repos
